# Project_Sphinx
This project is an implementation of different machine learning models into intrusion detection systems.

I wil start off with implementing a PyTorch model that analyzes PCAP files that are premarked by Surricata for DoS attacks.
This implementaion will not be real-time. After this, I will implment the solution to work in real-time.
I will then try it with other models to determine which works the best. I will then expand the model to test for other malicious
activities.

1/21/25: I am currently in the phase of implementing the analyzing of PCAP files. This is the day I created the repo.
